## Migration Notes

### For Developers
1. Review new RLS structure in `20240204000001_setup_rls.sql`
2. Note simplified session store interface
3. Update any custom queries to use `get_session_id()`

### For Testing
1. Single test file covers core scenarios
2. Clear separation of regular/admin tests
3. Added edge case coverage

## Rationale

Changes align implementation with PRD requirements while removing unnecessary complexity:

1. Session Management
   - Original: Complex state machine with claims
   - Now: Simple device-session relationship

2. Cross-Tab Sync
   - Original: Dual sync mechanisms
   - Now: Single storage event listener

3. Error Handling
   - Original: External service integration
   - Now: Basic error recovery
